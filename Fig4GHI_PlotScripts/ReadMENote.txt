Some note for the measuring:

1. For fracture energy, the end Indexes are chosen to be close to the end of the dynamic rupture, to make sure I capture the overshoot.

2. For ArDrop measure, the end Indexes are chosen to be right after the stopping phase generated by the right edge bounces back and reach the left end. Doing this will minimize the effect of Healing.

3 A potential issue (may not be a strong factor), When Calculating data/tau with Svet19 data, the final moment is the lowest point of stress. But it may not be correspond to the end moment in Ar diagram. So, the estimation of data/tau is a slightly overestimate, which is okay. Because we still find data/tau smaller than dAr/Ar.
